## Scripting Strategies and API Usage Examples

Many of the different MQTT implementations listed on the [Software page](http://mqtt.org/software) come with their own samples.

Another good source of example code is [Github](http://github.com) - search for "MQTT" - and __always respect the license__.

Below are approaches to common tasks and examples using the various APIs:

*  [Integrating Current Cost Meters](MQTT and Current Cost)

*  [Using Cosm (aka Pachube) with MQTT](MQTT and Pachube)

*  [Using MQTT with Apache Ant](https///tingenek.wordpress.com/2009/10/14/mqtt-ant-task/)

*  [MQTT and LotusScript for email automation](https///tingenek.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/mqtt-with-lotus-notes/)

*  [1-wire with MQTT](https///tingenek.wordpress.com/2012/02/05/1-wire-with-mqtt/) 

*  [Using MQTT with Twitter etc](MQTT and Microblogging)

*  [Logging MQTT Messages in Databases](MQTT and Databases)
